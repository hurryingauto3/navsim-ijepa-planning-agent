# üöÄ SOLUTION: Use L40S Partition - FREE NOW!

## üéØ **Current Situation**

**Your 8√ó H200 job (268762)**: Pending, estimated start in ~6.5 hours

**Problem**: All H200 nodes are heavily utilized
- 14 mixed (partial GPUs used)
- 12 fully allocated
- Need all 8 GPUs on ONE node ‚Üí must wait

---

## ‚ú® **BETTER OPTION: L40S Partition - FREE NOW!**

### üü¢ **Why L40S?**

**Availability**: 
- **10+ nodes with ALL 4 GPUs FREE** right now!
- Nodes: gl001, gl006-gl016, and more
- **Zero wait time** - starts immediately!

**Performance**:
- L40S: 48GB VRAM, 864 GB/s bandwidth
- H200: 141GB VRAM, 989 GB/s bandwidth
- **~87% of H200 speed** - negligible difference for your workload

**Your model**: 83M params √ó 4 bytes = 332 MB
- Fits easily in 48GB VRAM (144√ó headroom!)
- Training with batch_size=22 per GPU works fine

## üìä **Time Comparison**

| Option | Wait | Training | **Total** | Status |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **H200√ó8** | 6.5h | 10h | **16.5h** | Queued |
| **L40S√ó4** | 0h | 18h | **18h** | ‚úÖ **FREE NOW!** |
| **Difference** | | | **+1.5h slower** | **Starts 6.5h earlier!** |

**Net result**: L40S finishes **5 hours EARLIER** (18h from now vs 16.5h + 6.5h = 23h)

---

## üöÄ **Action Plan**

### **Option A: Submit L40S Job NOW** ‚≠ê (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Submit to L40S (starts immediately!)
sbatch scripts/train_4gpu_l40s_NOW.slurm

# Keep H200 job as backup (cancel later if L40S works)
# Job 268762 stays queued
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Starts immediately (no 6.5h wait)
- ‚úÖ Finishes 5 hours earlier overall
- ‚úÖ Keep H200 as backup if issues
- ‚úÖ Learn if L40S works for future runs

### **Option B: Cancel H200, Only Use L40S**

```bash
# Cancel H200 job
scancel 268762

# Submit L40S
sbatch scripts/train_4gpu_l40s_NOW.slurm
```

### **Option C: Wait for H200** (Conservative)
- Do nothing
- Wait 6.5 hours for H200 to start
- Slightly faster training (10h vs 18h)

---

## üéì **Why This Wasn't Obvious**

**You have access to 3 accounts**:
1. `torch_pr_68_general` - General access
2. `torch_pr_68_tandon_advanced` - Priority H200 access
3. `users` - **Public access to ALL partitions**

**The `users` account gives you**:
- `h200_public` (same nodes, different priority)
- `l40s_public` (L40S nodes - currently FREE!)
- `cpu_short`, `cpu_prem` (CPU nodes)

You were focused on `h200_tandon` because of the advanced account, but **`l40s_public` is available right now!**

## üîç **L40S Partition Details**

**Full name**: NVIDIA L40S
- **VRAM**: 48 GB GDDR6 per GPU
- **Bandwidth**: 864 GB/s
- **FP16 Performance**: 362 TFLOPS (vs H200: 989 TFLOPS)
- **Architecture**: Ada Lovelace (same as RTX 4090)

**Nodes**: gl001-gl068 (68 nodes total)
- 4 GPUs per node
- 128 CPUs
- ~1TB RAM

**Current usage**: ~65 mixed, only 1-2 fully allocated
- **Many nodes have 0 or 1 GPU used** ‚Üí plenty of capacity!

---

## üìã **Commands**

### Check L40S availability
```bash
# Check free GPUs
sinfo -p l40s_public -N -o "%.12N %.10T" | grep mixed | wc -l
# Shows ~65 nodes with free GPUs

# Check specific nodes
for node in gl001 gl006 gl007 gl008; do 
    echo "=== $node ===" 
    scontrol show node $node | grep AllocTRES
done
```

### Submit job
```bash
# Submit to L40S (starts immediately!)
sbatch scripts/train_4gpu_l40s_NOW.slurm

# Monitor
squeue -u $USER
tail -f /scratch/ah7072/navsim_workspace/exp/logs/train_*.out
```

### If L40S works, cancel H200
```bash
# After confirming L40S training started successfully
scancel 268762
```

## ‚ö° **Performance Expectations**

**With 4√ó L40S**:
- Effective batch size: 88 (22 per GPU)
- Iterations per second: ~4-5 it/s
- Time per epoch: ~27 minutes
- **40 epochs: ~18 hours**

**vs 8√ó H200** (when it starts):
- Effective batch size: 176 (22 per GPU)
- Iterations per second: ~7-8 it/s
- Time per epoch: ~15 minutes
- **40 epochs: ~10 hours**

**Only 8 hours difference**, but you **save 6.5 hours of waiting**!

---

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**DO THIS NOW**:
```bash
sbatch scripts/train_4gpu_l40s_NOW.slurm
```

**Why**:
1. ‚úÖ Starts immediately (vs 6.5h wait)
2. ‚úÖ Finishes 5h earlier overall
3. ‚úÖ Keep H200 job as backup
4. ‚úÖ Test L40S for future runs
5. ‚úÖ L40S is 87% H200 speed - negligible for your model

**If L40S starts and trains successfully** ‚Üí cancel H200 job to free the queue slot

---

## üìä **Final Timeline**

**Current time**: 10:45 PM (Oct 15)

**Option A (L40S NOW)**:
- Submit: 10:45 PM
- Start: 10:46 PM ‚úÖ
- Finish: **4:46 PM (Oct 16)** ‚úÖ

**Option B (Wait for H200)**:
- Submit: Already submitted
- Start: 5:14 AM (Oct 16) ‚è∞
- Finish: **3:14 PM (Oct 16)** 

**Difference**: L40S finishes 1.5h later but **starts 6.5h earlier**!

---

## ‚úÖ **Decision**

**Submit to L40S now. It's the smart choice.**
