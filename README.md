Below is a proposed multi-phase research plan that builds from a baseline NAVSIM setup to a novel planning scheme using world models with pre-trained I‑JEPA/N‑JEPA features. The plan is structured to incrementally introduce new components, validate them in simulation, and eventually integrate them into a complete planning system that could serve as the basis for an official research paper.

### Phase 0: Establish the NAVSIM Baseline
1.	Setup & Configuration
    - Environment: Install and configure NAVSIM on the CARLA simulator with standardized training/test splits.
    - Baseline Model: Run existing planning models (e.g., rule-based or simple sensor-driven policies) to record baseline metrics (PDMS, route completion, collision rates, etc.).
    - Evaluation: Define clear success criteria and evaluation protocols based on NAVSIM’s simulation-based metrics.

2.	Data & Metrics Collection
    - Ensure that your dataset is correctly downloaded and organized (as per NAVSIM’s instructions).
    - Record baseline performance on various driving scenarios (including challenging ones) for later comparison.

### Phase 1: Integrate Pre-Trained I‑JEPA/N‑JEPA Encoders
1.	Pre-Training the Encoder
    - Dataset: Use unlabeled driving data (either real-world or simulated) to pre-train an encoder using I‑JEPA or its variant N‑JEPA.
    - Objective: Learn high-level, semantic representations from masked image regions in a feature space—avoiding pixel-level reconstruction and heavy contrastive augmentations.
2.	Fine-Tuning for Driving Tasks
    - Steering Control: Fine-tune a lightweight head (or an MLP adapter) on a small set of labeled driving data to map the learned representations to control commands (e.g., steering angles).
    - Comparison: Benchmark the performance of the I‑JEPA-based approach against models initialized with standard weights (or using contrastive pre-training like DINO/SimCLR).
3.	Validation in Simulation
    - Integrate the fine-tuned model into NAVSIM.
    - Evaluate improvements in data efficiency and performance (e.g., improved PDMS or better route completion with fewer expert demonstrations).

### Phase 2: Develop and Integrate World Model–Based Planning
1.	World Model Design
    - Sequence Prediction (K-Imaginations):
    - Generate multiple candidate trajectories (imagine future states) by iteratively applying the world model over a planning horizon.
    - For each candidate action sequence, compute the resulting latent trajectory s_0 \rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow s_{k+1}.
2.	Planning Module Development
    - Cost Function: Define a cost (or distance) metric in the latent space that measures how close the predicted final state is to a desired target (e.g., a safe or optimal end state).
    - Trajectory Optimization:
    - Explore multiple action sequences.
    - Use techniques such as model predictive control (MPC) or tree search to evaluate candidate sequences.
    - Select the sequence that minimizes the cost while meeting safety, comfort, and progress criteria.
    - Predict Next Action: Ultimately, use the first action from the optimal sequence as the control command for the current time step.
3.	Integration & Validation
    - Simulated Testing in NAVSIM:
    - Replace or augment the existing planning module with the world model–based planner.
    - Validate the approach by comparing its performance (in terms of safety, efficiency, route completion) against the baseline and existing planning choices available in NAVSIM.
- Robustness Checks:
    - Test on diverse scenarios, including edge cases and challenging driving environments.
    - Potentially incorporate uncertainty estimates in the world model to improve planning reliability.

### Final Phase: Consolidation and Paper Preparation
1.	System Integration
- Merge the components: NAVSIM baseline, pre-trained encoder for representation learning, and world model–based planner.
- Ensure seamless operation from raw sensor input to optimal control decisions.
2.	Comprehensive Evaluation
- Perform extensive testing in simulation.
- Compare results quantitatively (using NAVSIM’s metrics) and qualitatively (observing driving behavior).
- Analyze label efficiency and robustness under varying conditions.
3.	Paper Drafting
- Document the methodology, experiments, and results.
- Highlight the contributions:
- Efficient representation learning using I‑JEPA/N‑JEPA.
- Novel integration of a world model for multi-step planning.
- Significant improvements in planning performance and data efficiency.
- Outline future directions and potential real-world applications.

### Key Points for Improvement with World Models
- Enhanced Prediction Accuracy:
Leverage the semantic power of the pre-trained encoder to improve latent space prediction of future states.
- Multi-Hypothesis Planning (K-Imagination):
Generate multiple candidate trajectories, compute distances or costs for each, and choose the optimal trajectory based on combined metrics (safety, progress, comfort).
- Optimal Action Selection:
Focus on predicting the next best action given the current data, rather than a single deterministic output—this allows for a more flexible and robust planning scheme.
- Iterative Refinement:
Combine reinforcement learning or policy optimization techniques with the world model to refine the planning strategy over time.

This plan should serve as a solid roadmap for your research project, guiding you from baseline setup through advanced planning integration using world models. Each phase builds on the previous one, ultimately culminating in a robust system that can be validated in NAVSIM and presented as an official research paper.
