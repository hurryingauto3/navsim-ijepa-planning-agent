Here is the final summary of the changes made to integrate the I-JEPA backbone into the Transfuser agent, including all troubleshooting steps:

### 1. Configuration (`transfuser_config.py`)

-   **Backbone Selection:** A `backbone` parameter was added to the `TransfuserConfig` class, allowing you to switch between `"resnet"` and `"ijepa"` in the Hydra configuration.
-   **Local Model Path:** The `ijepa_model_id` was updated to point to a local directory (`/scratch/ah7072/data/openscene/models/ijepa_vith14_1k`). This was a critical fix to resolve the `OSError`, as the HPC compute nodes do not have internet access to download models from the Hugging Face Hub. The model ID itself was also corrected to the valid `facebook/ijepa_vith14_1k`.

```python
@dataclass
class TransfuserConfig:
    """Global TransFuser config."""
    backbone: str = "resnet"
    ijepa_model_id: str = "/scratch/ah7072/data/openscene/models/ijepa_vith14_1k"
    # ... rest of the config
```

### 2. Backbone Implementation (`transfuser_backbone.py`)

-   **`IJEPABackbone` Class:** A new `IJEPABackbone` class was created to handle the I-JEPA model. It loads the model from the specified local path, freezes its parameters for feature extraction, and defines a forward pass.
-   **Architectural Separation (Final Fix):** The `TransfuserBackbone`'s `__init__` and `forward` methods were both refactored to create two completely distinct code paths for the `resnet` and `ijepa` backbones. This was the final fix for the persistent `AttributeError`, which was caused by the `forward` method attempting to call ResNet-specific layer iteration (`.items()`) on the I-JEPA model. The final implementation uses a clean `if/elif` block to ensure total separation of logic.
-   **I-JEPA Fusion Strategy (Final Fix):** The initial attempt at a simple fusion by reshaping the I-JEPA patch embeddings failed due to incorrect assumptions about the tensor shapes (`RuntimeError`). The final, robust solution uses a Perceiver-style `CrossAttentionFusion` module. This approach correctly handles the different data structures (sequence vs. grid):
    1.  A set of learnable latent queries is defined.
    2.  These queries attend to the sequence of I-JEPA image patch embeddings using cross-attention, distilling the most important visual information into a fixed-size set of latent vectors.
    3.  The latent vectors are then global average pooled to create a single, powerful feature vector representing the entire image.
    4.  This image feature vector is broadcast to match the spatial dimensions of the LiDAR feature map.
    5.  The two feature maps (broadcasted image vector and LiDAR grid) are concatenated and passed through a final projection layer to produce the fused output.

### 3. Model Compatibility (`transfuser_model.py`)

-   The `TransfuserModel` was updated to correctly handle the single fused feature map produced by the I-JEPA backbone path. The logic now seamlessly passes this fused output to the subsequent layers of the model.

### 4. Agent Logic (`transfuser_agent.py`)

-   **Image Preprocessing:** The `TransfuserAgent` now initializes the I-JEPA `AutoProcessor` from the local model directory. In the `forward` method, a check was added to use this processor to correctly format the images (`pixel_values`) before they are sent to the backbone, but only when the `ijepa` backbone is active.

```python
class TransfuserAgent(AbstractAgent):
    def __init__(self, config: TransfuserConfig, ...):
        # ...
        if self._config.backbone == "ijepa":
            self.processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(self._config.ijepa_model_id)
        # ...

    def forward(self, features: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
        if self._config.backbone == "ijepa":
            # Preprocess the image features before passing to the model
            features["camera_feature"] = self.processor(images=features["camera_feature"], return_tensors="pt")["pixel_values"]
        return self._transfuser_model(features)
```

### 5. SLURM Script (`transfuser_train_ijepa_100pc.slurm`)

-   The Hydra command-line override was corrected from `agent.params.backbone` to `agent.config.backbone=ijepa` to ensure the backbone selection is correctly passed to the configuration.

These combined changes create a functional and flexible system for your experiments, resolving the errors related to offline model loading and architectural mismatches.
